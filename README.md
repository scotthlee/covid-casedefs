# Household transmission case definition study

## Overview
Describe the purpose of your project. Add additional sections as necessary to help collaborators and potential collaborators understand and use your project.

## The code
We used both R and Python to do the analysis for this study. There's a good deal of overlap between the two sets of code, but in general, the R code is geared toward generating our graphics, while the Python code is geared toward generating the statistics we report in the tables. Here's quick manifest of the scripts:

  ### Python
  1. (tools.py)[https://github.com/scotthlee/hh-transmission/blob/master/python/tools.py]: support functions used for the analysis
  2. (multi.py)[https://github.com/scotthlee/hh-transmission/blob/master/python/multi.py]: multiprocessing-enabled versions of functions from `tools.py`
  3. (combo_search.py)[https://github.com/scotthlee/hh-transmission/blob/master/python/combo_search.py]: runs the combinatorial symptom search
  4. (rf.py)[https://github.com/scotthlee/hh-transmission/blob/master/python/rf.py]: trains a random forest on the data
  5. (primary_analysis.py)[https://github.com/scotthlee/hh-transmission/blob/master/python/primary_analysis.py]: produces the statistics and tables in the manuscript

## The data
In the data, we have information about symptoms for each of the study participants, and we also have their SARS-CoV-2 PCR and ELISA test results. In our primary analysis, we frame the problem as one of binary classification, i.e., by predicting PCR status from different combinations of the symptoms. Here's a quick rundown of the variables:

  1. `study_id`: participant identifier
  2. `hh_id`: household identifier
  3. `age_adult`: whether age is over (1) or under (0) 18 years
  4. `wheeze` to `tastesmell_combo`: the symptoms
  5. `ili`: influenza-like illness
  6. `cdc`: CDC's COVID symptom list
  7. `ari`: the WHO RSV ARI case definition
  8. `cste`: the CSTE COVID case definition
  9. `cli`: COVID-like illness
  10. `vaccine`s: CDC COVID vaccine group proposed trial endpoints
  11. `sero_pos`: whether ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
  12. `sero_conv`: whether the contact seroconverted during the 2-week observation period
  13. `pcr_pos`: whether RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 infection
  14. `any_pos`: whether ELISA or RT-PCR was positive
